# WhatsQt

WhatsQt is bringing WhatsApp Web natively to OS X, Linux and Windows. WhatsQt integrates seamlessly into your existing environment. You do not have to search the WhatsApp Web browser tab anymore, WhatsQt is a standalone application.

**Please note:** This project is not related in any way to WhatsApp, it is just a private hobby!

### How does it work?

WhatsQt is written in C++ and uses the Qt GUI framework, which also offers a module called QtWebEngine. The QtWebEngine is used to render WhatsApp Web and execute the JavaScript code.
